# How to set up a Private, Remote and Virtual npm Registry

![](image/screenshot1.png)

The simplest way to manage and organize your Node dependencies is with an [npm repository](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/npm+Registry). You need reliable, secure, consistent and efficient access to your dependencies that are shared across your team, in a central location. Including a place to set up multiple registries, that work transparently with the npm client.

With the [JFrog free cloud subscription](https://jfrog.com/start-free/), including JFrog Artifactory, Xray and Pipelines, you can set up a [free local, remote and virtual npm registry](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Repository+Management) in minutes. This blog post will take you through the steps.

## Before you start
Here’s what you’ll need:

   * [npm client installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started)
   * [JFrog self-hosted subscription or JFrog cloud subscription](https://jfrog.com/start-free/#hosted)
   * [JFrog CLI installed](https://jfrog.com/getcli/)
## Login to your environment

1. Login using the default username: admin, and password: password for the on-prem installation, or the credentials provided to you by email for the cloud installation.
