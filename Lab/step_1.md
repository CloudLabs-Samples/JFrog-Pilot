# How to set up a Private, Remote and Virtual npm Registry

![](image/screenshot1.png)

The simplest way to manage and organize your Node dependencies is with an [npm repository](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/npm+Registry). You need reliable, secure, consistent and efficient access to your dependencies that are shared across your team, in a central location. Including a place to set up multiple registries, that work transparently with the npm client.

With the [JFrog free cloud subscription](https://jfrog.com/start-free/), including JFrog Artifactory, Xray and Pipelines, you can set up a [free local, remote and virtual npm registry](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Repository+Management) in minutes. This blog post will take you through the steps.
