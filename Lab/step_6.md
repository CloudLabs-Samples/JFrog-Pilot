## Task 6: Configure JFrog CLI and build the project with npm

In this task, you will continue to be within the VM that is provided to you and configure the JFrog CLI to build the project with [npm](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory#CLIforJFrogArtifactory-BuildingNpmPackagesUsingtheNpmClient) and resolve the project dependencies from Artifactory.

1. Within the SSH Session to the VM, execute the following commands to install JFrog CLI:

    ```
    sudo su -
    wget -qO - https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-gpg-public/jfrog_public_gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
    echo "deb https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-debs xenial contrib" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt install -y jfrog-cli-v2-jf
    ```


1. Execute the following command to configure the [Artifactory server](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory#CLIforJFrogArtifactory-Configuration).
  
    ```
    jf c add
    ```
